Education
======
* Master of Machine learning and Computer vision, Australian National University, 2023 (expected)
* Bachelor of Science (Engineering) with Honours,Queen Mary University of London (QMUL), First Class, 2020
* B.E. in Telecommunications Engineering with Management,Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT), 2020

Research experience
======
* December 2021–August 2022, Vision Technology Department, Baidu: Research intern
  * Supervised by Wuqi Man and Jiang Wang (leader: Jingdong Wang)
  * Submitted one paper about Real-Time Segmentation on NeurIPS 2022, this method achieves SOTA accuracy and
    speed trade-off in Ade20k, Cityscape, Camvid, and COCOStuff datasets.
  * Research on fast and efficient Transformer structure and also the efficient hybrid model (CNN and Transformer).

* December 2020 –June 2021, Perception Algorithm Intern of Autonomous Driving, NIO Inc, Research intern
  * Supervised by Ziwei Chen
  * Researched on Road and Car-Lane Detection and Segmentation.
  * Developed an end-to-end car lane detection method based on Transformer.
  * Increased current detection model performance by using attention method.
  * Increased current model performance using 2x input image without affecting the model size and speed.

* December 2020 –June 2021, Computer Vision Algorithm Research Team, Aibee Inc.: Research intern
  * Supervised by JiangFan Deng, Feng Zhou (Tech Leader of Aibee).
  * Researched on video completion and object removal. Conducted experiments on different state-of-the-art algorithms
  * Suggested a new method to solve the object removal problem; it included object detection and pixel propagation
  * Implemented the proposed new idea and optimised code running time from 0.25 fps to 2 fps. This work has been
   officially put into use as an important component in a VR indoor map item of a shopping mall.
